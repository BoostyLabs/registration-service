# Signal registration service

This is a multi-provider phone number verification service for use with Signal.

When Signal users first create an account, they do so by associating that account with a phone number. Signal verifies that users actually control that phone number by sending a verification code to that number via SMS or via a phone call. This service manages the process of sending verification codes and checking codes provided by clients.

## Major components

External callers interact with this service by sending [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) requests. The gRPC interface is defined in [`registration_service.proto`](./src/main/proto/registration_service.proto). gRPC requests are handled by [`RegistrationServiceGrpcEndpoint`](./src/main/java/org/signal/registration/rpc/RegistrationServiceGrpcEndpoint.java), which sanitizes client input and dispatches requests to [`RegistrationService`](./src/main/java/org/signal/registration/RegistrationService.java), which orchestrates the major business logic for the entire service.

`RegistrationService` uses a [`SenderSelectionStrategy`](./src/main/java/org/signal/registration/sender/SenderSelectionStrategy.java) to choose a concrete [`VerificationCodeSender`](./src/main/java/org/signal/registration/sender/VerificationCodeSender.java) implementation to send a verification code to a client. `VerificationCodeSenders` are responsible for sending verification codes via a specific transport (i.e. SMS or voice) and service provider and later for verifying codes provided by clients. A [`SessionRepository`](./src/main/java/org/signal/registration/session/SessionRepository.java) stores session data (i.e. verification codes or references to external verification sessions) for `VerificationCodeSenders`.

## Configuration

At a minimum, the registration service needs at least one `VerificationCodeSender`, a `SenderSelectionStrategy`, and a `SessionRepository`. No beans of those types will be instantiated unless they're configured, and so some configuration properties must be provided. The following table describes the currently-supported (and required, in production environments) configuration properties.

### Running in development mode

For local testing, this service can be run in the `dev` [Micronaut environment](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#environments). In the `dev` environment, the following components are provided (assuming no others of have been configured):

- A trivial verification code sender that always uses the last six digits of a phone number as a verification code
- A trivial sender selection strategy that always chooses the last-six-digits "sender"
- An in-memory session store

These components are, obviously, not suitable for production use and are intended only to facilitate local development and testing.
